        Figure~\ref{fig:ueq-distribution} presents participants' response to the individual item of the questionnaire which confirms that the \ac{CA} was easy to learn, easy to use, understandable (perspicuity); friendly (attractiveness) and well organized (efficiency).

                \caption{Distribution of UEQ Answers per item (n=20). Labels 1 to 7 represent the spectrum of user's gradations between the opposite attributes of \acl{app} as such 1 denotes user's strong agreement with the negative attribute, 7 reflects positive impression and 4 indicates neutral sentiment. For example, users' response 1 to UEQ item `conservative/innovative' means their agreement that the system is conservative, 7 indicates that the system is innovative, and 4 represents users' neutral feedback. Annotations within the distribution represent the frequency of users' score.}

        Table \ref{tab:ueq_summary} shows the statistical summary of the participants' response to \ac{UEQ} scale.

        Figure~\ref{fig:ueq-benchmark} illustrates the \ac{CA}'s \ac{UEQ} score compared to the benchmark data. The figure shows that the \ac{CA} is rated `excellent' for perspicuity which means that the rating is in the range of the 10\% of the best results in the benchmark data. Attractiveness, efficiency, and novelty were rated as `below average' which means 50\% of the results in the benchmark are better than the result for the evaluated system and 25\% of the results are worse. Finally, dependability and stimulation were rated as `bad' meaning that the the system is rated in range of the 25\% worst results in the benchmark data.

        The internal consistency of the \ac{UEQ} dimensions measured by Cronbach-Alpha in our evaluation resulted sufficient in terms of attractiveness ($\alpha = 0.89$), perspicuity ($\alpha = 0.76$) and stimulation ($\alpha = 0.73$). Whereas, the Cronbach-Alpha values for efficiency ($\alpha = 0.44$), dependability ($\alpha = 0.29$) and novelty ($\alpha = 0.57$) indicate poor internal consistency suggesting that the several participants might have interpreted the questions differently in the given context.
