abstract = { Conversational interfaces have risen in popularity as businesses and users adopt a range of conversational agents, including chatbots and voice assistants. Although guidelines have been proposed, there is not yet an established set of usability heuristics to guide and evaluate conversational agent design. In this paper, we propose a set of heuristics for conversational agents adapted from Nielsen’s heuristics and based on expert feedback. We then validate the heuristics through two rounds of evaluations conducted by participants on two conversational agents, one chatbot and one voice-based personal assistant. We find that, when using our heuristics to evaluate both interfaces, evaluators were able to identify more usability issues than when using Nielsen’s heuristics. We propose that our heuristics successfully identify issues related to dialogue content, interaction design, help and guidance, human-like characteristics, and data privacy.},

Specifically, they can be used to provide support for real-time family therapy and interventions in a scalable way. However, this requires significant changes in traditional therapeutic content since interaction with CAs is fundamentally different than reading or using eHealth applications. In this work, we aim to identify challenges in adapting a clinically validated therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to conversational agents. Specifically, we describe our initial design and development process to use Amazon Alexa to deliver Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) for PTSD. Our initial design process resulted in an interaction model that emphasizes short dialogues and interactivity. This design process and interaction model can potentially be useful for future studies focusing on using conversational agents for therapeutic content delivery.},

abstract = {This paper explores how humans adapt to a conventional humanoid robot. Video data of participants playing a charade game with a Nao robot were analyzed from a multimodal conversation analysis perspective. Participants soon adjust aspects of turn-design such as word selection, turn length and prosody, thereby adapting to the robot's limited perceptive abilities as they become apparent in the interaction. However, coordination of turns-at-talk remains troublesome throughout the encounter, as evidenced by overlapping turns and lengthy silences around possible turn endings. The study discusses how the robot design can be improved to support the problematic taking of turns-at-talk with humans. Two programming strategies to address the identified problems are presented: 1. to program the robot so that it will be systematically receptive at the equivalence to transition relevance places in human-human interaction, and 2. to make the robot preferably produce verbal actions that require a response in a conditional way, rather than making a response only possible.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how the choice of media for capture and access affects the diary study method. The diary study is a method of understanding participant behavior and intent in situ that minimizes the effects of observers on participants. We first situate diary studies within a framework of field studies and review related literature. We then report on three diary studies we conducted that involve photographs, audio recordings, location information and tangible artifacts. We then analyze our findings, specifically addressing the following questions: How do context information and episodic memory prompts captured by participants vary with media? In what way do different media "jog" memory? How do different media affect the diary study process? These questions are particularly important for diary studies because they can be especially useful as compared to other methods when a participant intends to do an action but does not or when actions are particularly difficult to sense. We also built and tested a tool based on participant and researcher frustrations with the method. Our contribution includes suggested modifications to traditional diary techniques that enable annotation and review of captured media; a new variation on the diary study appropriate for researchers using digital capture media; and a lightweight tool to support it, motivated by past work and findings from our studies.},

Researchers have used the ESM in a wide variety of studies, with the method seeing increased popularity. Mobile technologies have enabled new possibilities for the use of the ESM, while simultaneously leading to new conceptual, methodological, and technological challenges. In this survey, we provide an overview of the history of the ESM, usage of this methodology in the computer science discipline, as well as its evolution over time. Next, we identify and discuss important considerations for ESM studies on mobile devices, and analyse the particular methodological parameters scientists should consider in their study design. We reflect on the existing tools that support the ESM methodology and discuss the future development of such tools. Finally, we discuss the effect of future technological developments on the use of the ESM and identify areas requiring further investigation.},

In our two-stage study (online listening test and lab evaluation), we compared participants' perception of the persuasiveness of synthetic voices created from speech in a debating style vs. speech from audio-books. Participants interacted with our Conversational Agent (CA) to complete 4 flight-booking tasks and were asked to evaluate the voice, message and perceived personal qualities. We found that participants who interacted with the CA using the voice created from debating style speech rated it as significantly more truthful and more involved than the CA using the audio-book-based voice. However, there was no difference in how frequently each group followed the CA's recommendations. We hope our investigation will provoke discussion about the impact of different synthetic voices on users' perceptions of CAs in goal-oriented tasks.},

abstract = {Speech and natural language remain our most natural form of interaction; yet the HCI community have been very timid about focusing their attention on designing and developing spoken language interaction techniques. This may be due to a widespread perception that perfect domain-independent speech recognition is an unattainable goal. Progress is continuously being made in the engineering and science of speech and natural language processing, however, and there is also recent research that suggests that many applications of speech require far less than 100\% accuracy to be useful in many contexts. Engaging the CHI community now is timely -- many recent commercial applications, especially in the mobile space, are already tapping the increased interest in and need for natural user interfaces (NUIs) by enabling speech interaction in their products. As such, the goal of this panel is to bring together interaction designers, usability researchers, and general HCI practitioners to discuss the opportunities and directions to take in designing more natural interactions based on spoken language, and to look at how we can leverage recent advances in speech processing in order to gain widespread acceptance of speech and natural language interaction.},

As such, we evaluated TTS voices for long-form content: not individual words or sentences, but voices that are pleasant to listen to for several minutes at a time. We introduce a method using a crowdsourcing platform and an online survey to evaluate voices based on listening experience, perception of clarity and quality, and comprehension. We evaluated 18 TTS voices, three human voices, and a text-only control condition. We found that TTS voices are close to rivaling human voices, yet no single voice outperforms the others across all evaluation dimensions. We conclude with considerations for selecting text-to-speech voices for long-form content.},

abstract = {The number of people with vision impairments using Conversational Agents (CAs) has increased because of the potential of this technology to support them. As many visually impaired people are accustomed to understanding fast speech, most screen readers or voice assistant systems offer speech rate settings. However, current CAs are designed to interact at a human-like speech rate without considering their accessibility. In this study, we tried to understand how people with vision impairments use CA at a fast speech rate. We conducted a 20-day in-home study that examined the CA use of 10 visually impaired people at default and fast speech rates. We investigated the difference in visually impaired people's CA use with different speech rates and their perception toward CA at each rate. Based on these findings, we suggest considerations for the future design of CA speech rate for those with visual impairments.},
